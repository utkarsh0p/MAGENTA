# Repository Guidelines

## Project

This project is `HumanTouch`.

HumanTouch is a focused company agent management app where an admin can create,
assign, and manage AI agents for employees.

The longer-term goal is to make this agent system integration-ready so it can
attach to a larger existing business application and reuse that application's
backend, users, roles, and PostgreSQL data model.

This repository contains two sibling workspaces:

- `BACKEND/`: Fastify + TypeScript backend for HumanTouch APIs and chat runtime.
- `FRONTEND/`: Next.js + Tailwind frontend for the HumanTouch app UI.

Backend source lives in `BACKEND/src/`, with chat workflow code under
`BACKEND/src/workflows/chat/` when that structure exists. Frontend app routes
live in `FRONTEND/app/`, and shared UI components live in
`FRONTEND/components/`.

Each workspace has its own `AGENTS.md`; read the relevant one before product or
architecture changes.

## Canonical Markdown Files

These markdown files are part of the working project context, but they should be
pulled in only when the task needs them.

- `AGENTS.md`
  Use for project guardrails, product direction, and repo-specific working
  rules.
- `BACKEND/AGENTS.md`
  Use for backend API, runtime, persistence, auth, and integration decisions.
- `BACKEND/ROUTES.md`
  Use before adding, renaming, removing, or consuming backend routes.
- `BACKEND/SCHEMA.md`
  Use when the task touches database design, auth/access modeling, assignments,
  sessions, prompt storage, message history, or LangGraph checkpoint boundaries.
- `FRONTEND/AGENTS.md`
  Use for frontend architecture, UX, state, and API-consumption decisions.
- `FRONTEND/style/STYLES.md`
  Use only for frontend visual work, typography, style direction, or UI
  consistency questions.

Do not load all markdown files into context by default. Use only the files
relevant to the task at hand.

## Build, Test, And Development Commands

Run commands from the workspace they belong to.

Backend:

- `npm run dev`: start the Fastify server with `tsx watch`.
- `npm run check`: run TypeScript without emitting files.
- `npm run build`: compile backend TypeScript to `dist/`.
- `npm start`: run the compiled backend from `dist/server.js`.

Frontend:

- `npm run dev`: start the Next.js development server.
- `npm run build`: create a production Next.js build.
- `npm start`: serve the production build.
- `npm run lint`: run Next linting if supported by the installed Next version.

## Current Product Scope

The intended product model assumes:

- one seeded demo company
- one seeded admin user
- one built-in `Admin` agent
- admin-created custom agents
- direct user assignment and role-based assignment
- per-session employee `user_prompt`

Admin users can:

- create agents
- edit agents
- assign agents to employees or roles
- access company agent/session data

Normal employees should later:

- log in
- see only assigned agents
- chat with those agents using their own session-level style prompt

## Core Product Model

The product should support:

- real `companies` and `users` tables
- one default `Admin` agent
- multiple chat sessions/history
- backend-persisted sessions
- agent execution through LangGraph
- future support for custom agents created by admin
- generated/stored `system_prompt` per agent
- per-session employee `user_prompt`

The architecture should remain compatible with later parent-app integration for
users, companies, roles, and PostgreSQL reuse.

## Session Model

Each chat is a session with its own `thread_id`.

Requirements:

- users can create multiple sessions
- session history appears in the UI
- session state is restored from the backend
- LangGraph checkpointer is used for persistence
- PostgreSQL is the initial persistence store
- session storage should remain compatible with future foreign keys such as
  `company_id`, `created_by_user_id`, and `agent_id`

## Agent Model

Current intended state:

- one default `Admin` agent is seeded
- admin can create additional agents
- each agent stores structured `agent_info`
- each agent stores a generated `system_prompt`
- access is granted through role assignments and direct user assignments

Future state:

- employees only see agents assigned to them
- agent prompt generation can become more sophisticated without changing the
  runtime model
- auth/login can move from dev auth to full production auth
- the built-in `Admin` agent may later act as a coordinator that assigns work
  to other company agents, gathers their outputs, and returns a consolidated
  result to the human admin

Design the data model so agent definitions remain separate from conversation
history.

Future orchestration direction:

- keep human-to-agent chat as the initial UX
- later support admin-to-admin-agent orchestration across multiple subordinate
  agents
- treat delegated multi-agent work as a separate orchestration or run model, not
  as a replacement for normal chat sessions
- keep permissions explicit so the coordinating `Admin` agent can only delegate
  within the company's allowed agent set
- preserve a clean separation between agent definitions, conversation history,
  and future delegated work execution records

## Expected UX

Keep the first UI simple:

- sidebar for sessions
- main chat area
- current agent indicator
- room for future execution/progress state

Provider/account UX:

- keep HumanTouch login identity distinct from connected external provider
  accounts
- show the current HumanTouch user email near provider connection controls
- show each connected provider account as
  `Connected as <provider email/account id>`
- use an on/off toggle pattern for provider connections
- off/not connected starts the provider OAuth connect flow
- on/connected disconnects the provider and clears stored tokens
- do not imply that the HumanTouch login email must match Google, GitHub, or
  other provider emails

## Architecture Direction

- frontend: Next.js + Tailwind CSS in `FRONTEND/`
- backend: Node.js + TypeScript in `BACKEND/`
- backend framework: Fastify
- ORM for HumanTouch product tables: Prisma when database work is implemented
- orchestration: LangGraph.js
- model provider: Google Gemini via environment variable
- persistence: PostgreSQL

Integration direction:

- build the backend so it can run either as a standalone service or be mounted
  into a larger Node.js backend
- keep agent tables logically isolated, ideally in a dedicated PostgreSQL schema
- avoid creating a separate source of truth for users, employees, companies, or
  roles
- keep LangGraph checkpoint tables outside Prisma ownership

## Backend Direction

Keep the backend as a single Node.js service.

- use Fastify for all backend APIs, not only LangGraph routes
- keep LangGraph execution inside the same TypeScript backend
- do not introduce a split backend architecture
- use Server-Sent Events (SSE) for response streaming
- use PostgreSQL for chat sessions/history and LangGraph checkpoint persistence
- use Prisma migrations for HumanTouch product table changes once Prisma is
  added to this rebuild
- prefer a service/module structure that can later be reused inside a larger
  backend
- keep route contracts stable and simple
- keep auth and authorization separated
- keep company scoping explicit in backend queries
- use request user context consistently
- build LangGraph runtime state in backend services before graph execution
- keep the main workflow as the single graph entrypoint, with admin and employee
  behavior in separate subgraphs
- register tools centrally and bind only each selected agent's allowed tools at
  runtime
- allow LLM tool recommendation only as a suggestion step; persist only
  backend-validated tool IDs

## Auth And Provider Integrations

Keep app login auth separate from connected-account provider integrations.

- HumanTouch auth identifies the app user and owns workspace access, agent
  permissions, sessions, and company scoping
- connected-account providers grant external tokens for tools and are owned by
  the current HumanTouch user
- Google login uses NextAuth in the frontend and only creates/restores the
  HumanTouch user session when that integration exists
- Google, GitHub, LinkedIn, and Meta in the provider menu are tool integrations,
  not necessarily login methods
- backend integration OAuth callbacks store encrypted provider tokens in
  `connected_accounts`
- provider accounts may use different emails/usernames than the HumanTouch user;
  this is expected and allowed
- frontend integration proxy routes must support both NextAuth users and local
  `humantouch_session` cookie users when that bridge is implemented
- root `.env` is the intended source of truth for auth/provider secrets;
  `FRONTEND/.env.local` should only keep frontend-local values like
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`

## Current Non-Goals

Do not add these unless explicitly requested:

- `shadcn/ui`
- multi-provider model abstraction
- MCP integrations
- vector search / RAG
- additional built-in agents beyond `Admin`
- full multi-agent delegation workflows in the first release

Also avoid these unless explicitly requested:

- deep coupling to one company's existing proprietary schema before the
  integration shape is known
- background job systems
- websocket infrastructure when SSE is sufficient
- premature multi-tenant abstractions in the UI

## Guardrails

- no sensitive external action without approval
- strict role-based access control
- enforce tool access in backend code, not only through prompts
- keep v1 small and extensible
- design for future multi-agent expansion, but do not build all agents now
- keep backend logic integration-friendly for a larger PostgreSQL-based app
- avoid MongoDB-specific assumptions anywhere in the code or data model
- prefer clear interfaces between API, persistence, and agent orchestration
  layers

## Immediate Build Assumption

Unless changed, build around this assumption:

- single-company product
- CEO is the admin
- seeded admin user exists in the database once persistence is implemented
- one default `Admin` agent exists
- Google Gemini is the only model provider for now
- admin will later create and assign more agents
- sessions and history are first-class features
- PostgreSQL is the system of record
- the architecture should be ready to later reuse parent-app users, roles, and
  company data
- a later phase may allow the `Admin` agent to break work into sub-tasks for
  other agents and collect the results centrally

## Coding Style And Naming Conventions

Use TypeScript with strict types. Prefer small modules named after product
concepts, such as `routes.ts`, `chatWorkflow.ts`, or page route directories.
Keep backend route contracts explicit with stable IDs. Use Tailwind utilities
for frontend styling and keep the UI operational and app-focused.

Use two-space indentation and double quotes in TypeScript. Avoid broad
abstractions until repeated behavior makes them necessary.

## Testing Guidelines

No dedicated test framework is currently configured. Before finishing code
changes, run the relevant TypeScript/build checks:

- Backend changes: `cd BACKEND && npm run check`
- Frontend changes: `cd FRONTEND && npm run build`

When tests are added, keep them close to the code they cover and use clear
behavior-focused names, for example `chatWorkflow.test.ts`.

## Commit And Pull Request Guidelines

No reliable Git history is available in this checkout, so use concise,
imperative commit messages, for example `Add chat stream validation`. Pull
requests should include a summary, verification steps, linked issues when
applicable, and screenshots for visible frontend changes.

## Security And Configuration Tips

Keep secrets in local environment files and never commit API keys or OAuth
tokens. The backend currently requires `GEMINI_API_KEY`; optional configuration
includes `PORT`, `HOST`, `GEMINI_MODEL`, and `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`.

HumanTouch app authentication and external provider OAuth connections are
separate concerns. Do not rely on prompts as the only access-control layer.
